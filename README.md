# Crazy Synth

crosshairs rotation while mouse down should be hundred percent
parameter for how long mouse has travelled overall

stil yet to try just pumpin the audio over the channel xd


electric harp instrument dragging across chordy boys

yeyeye with specified scale


record path of things and loop it back

if u can have more range by scrolling is maybe good



Ok where is my waveguide synth
okiir or...
yea just needs a ring buffer a d

analog would have more random drifts etc.
imagine a really small drift on some parameters like if its really shitty
and dude envelope would make a big difference too
low freqs maybe or

left is fine on right and just always 100% i like that
also really like the vinyl pops vibe on the retarded timing thing

1.0 1.0|0.044 0.020|-0.6 -0.4 higher gold band, cool
1.0 1.0|0.244 0.481|-0.6 -0.4 bass gold band

i think one of the fm params may still need to be multiplied to frequency but this is pretty cool

flick control on the left
time thing sucks dick and needs to be phase

specialized fm drone pad
figure out what it is about those regions where it does that sick shit
get fft and osc view
